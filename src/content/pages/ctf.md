title: Capture the Flag
---

As part of the LOCKDONE-athon, we're planning a Capture the Flag competition!

It's currently not up and running yet, but we'll be launching it a few days
into the event, so keep your eyes peeled!

## How it works

- Each team creates an account on the score-tracker and works together to
  solve the challenges there
- Each challenge is worth a certain number of points, which can be gained by
  "capturing the flag" for that challenge
- The flag will look something like `LOCK{helloworld}`.
  - Each flag will begin with `LOCK` and then contain curly braces around
    the rest of it
  - Only the bit in the curly braces will change between flags
- At the end of the CTF, the team with the most points will win!
